Wine_Quality_Analysis.py
- This program provides the complete analysis over the red wine data. It uses least-squares linear regression and LASSO regression on the original data and calculates average error. It then determines the strength of the principal component. It chooses k clusters to add as features to the data using k-means algorithm. The error calculation is then repeated.
- Produces a graph of the error analysis, the LASSO weights before and after the addition of the k-means clusters, and prints least-squares linear regression error, the weights of both regression models, and the condition number of the data before and after the addition of clusters.

Wine_Quality_Analysis_white.py
- This program provides the complete analysis over the white wine data. It uses least-squares linear regression and LASSO regression on the original data and calculates average error. It then determines the strength of the principal component. It chooses k clusters to add as features to the data using k-means algorithm. The error calculation is then repeated.
- Produces a graph of the error analysis, the LASSO weights before and after the addition of the k-means clusters, and prints least-squares linear regression error, the weights of both regression models, and the condition number of the data before and after the addition of clusters.
